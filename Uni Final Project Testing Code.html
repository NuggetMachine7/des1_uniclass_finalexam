<p>The Pesto Manifesto</p>
<p> this is the pesto manifesto: an improvised recipe of sorts</p>
<p>when making pesto, here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>must use organic garlic if you live in the 21st Ce</li>
  <li>must use fresh basil from your mom or neighbor’s garden.</li>
  <li>must use pine nuts.</li>
  <li>no food processing allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made RIGHT.</p>
<p>Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity! or should it?</p>
<ul>
  <li>become inspired by mediocre productions.</li>
  <li> don’t covert production and experimentation recipe</li>
  <li>always leave the edges rough, so that someone can cut themselves</li>
  <li>a photoshop’d joke is DEEP and MEANINGFUL</li>
  <li>take the knife to cultural icons and produce: produce the produce for the recipe and destroy the recipe</li>
  <li> follow and muddy up every else’s recipe; pun and play, annihilate and resurrect MEANING</li>
</ul>
<p>keep in mind:</p>
<p>pesto is delicious when it’s made FRESH.</p>
